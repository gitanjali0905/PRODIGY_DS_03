# AIM :-
- Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data.
- Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
  
# Dataset :-
[Dataset Link]([https://www.canva.com/link?target=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kaggle.com%2Fc%2Ftitanic%2Fdata&design=DAFpRxy47kU&accessRole=viewer&linkSource=document](https://www.canva.com/link?target=https%3A%2F%2Farchive.ics.uci.edu%2Fml%2Fdatasets%2FBank%2BMarketing&design=DAFpRxy47kU&accessRole=viewer&linkSource=document))

# Steps :-
1.Data preparetion
2.Explanatory Data Analysis
3.Ploting various plots
4.Exploiting and gaining insight from this plot
5. Traning and testing spliting 
6. Building a classifier model(Decision Tree)
7. Training the model
8. Model evaluation 
9. Saving the model
10.Documenting and reporting insight
